# Shin PokÃ©mon Red and Blue

Version 1.05 beta4

Download the IPS patch file of the version you want and apply it to its respective USA rom.

This is a rom hack of pokemon red & blue based on the Pret team's disassembly.  
This is a mostly-vanilla hack that focuses on fixing glitches from the original game.  
Additionally, trainer AI routines are also improved and includes minimal quality-of-life improvements.  
Think of it as what the Nintendo Virtual Console re-release of red & blue might have been.

#Summary
-----------

- Tons of bugs, glitches, and oversights fixed
- Trainers are made more difficult not by increasing their team levels, but by doing the following:
  - Vastly improving the default ai routines
  - Giving them access to stat experience
  - Giving them above-average random DVs
  - Trainers of a smart-enough trainer class will make use of basic pkmn switching
- All 151 pkmn are available in one version
  - Though difficult for a select few, each pkmn can be obtained multiple times
  - The uniquness between red & blue is still preserved in encounter rarity
- Minor quality-of-life improvements
  - When a pkmn is caught and fills the box, a reminder is printed that the box is full
  - Move relearner and deleter
  - Nearly all trainers can be rematched just by talking to them a 2nd time after their most recent defeat
  - Due to on-demand rematches, you could do a pseudo-"new game+" by boxing your pkmn and rematching everyone in order
  - There is an NPC that generates a trainer battle with a randomized roster
  - CUT not needed to get to Lt. Surge and Erika (a blocking event replaces the Vermilion shrub)
  - Stone evolutions regain some level-up moves
  - Yellow-version move lists have been integrated
  - All TMs can be repurchased as they are strategically scattered across all the Kanto pokemarts
  - After the elite-4, a new vendor opens up in celadon allowing the purchase of normally unique items
  - Added some special trainer battles as fun little easter eggs
  - A pkmn plays its cry to signal the last turn of using a trapping move like wrap/clamp/etc
- Minimal changes to battle mechanics necessitated by AI improvements
  - Trapping moves now have reduced priority and they end (using up the turn) if the target switches
    - Prevents PP underflow glitch
	- Prevents merciless abuse of wrap by ekans trainers that caused unwinnable battles without level-grinding
  - Adjustment to the sleep condition
    - Sleep does not prevent choosing a move
	- Waking up from sleep does not waste the turn and the chosen move is used
- You can hunt for shiny pokemon
  - DVs are checked to see if a pokemon would be shiny in the gen 2 games
  - If a pokemon has shiny DVs, then it will play the Reflect animation when entering battle
  - If playing on a super gameboy, shiny pkmn will have a palette swap on the status screen and also change color in battle
- Potentially compatible with Pokemon Stadium 1 & 2
- Might be possible to use a save from vanilla USA red/blue with this rom hack (save in RED's house before transferring over)


#Hack-Induced Bugfixes & Adjustments in this version:
-----------
- Some custom functions shuffled into bank2D to free memory in bankF
- unused_stats_functions.asm renamed and put to actual use for custom functions
- trainer stat exp calculation function made more efficient
- On most trainers, the rematch text now only plays the second time after talking to a defeated generic trainer
  - Example: after defeating a lass and talking to her, she will play her post-battle text. 
    - Talk to her again to get the rematch option.
  - Example: after defeating a lass, talking to a different defeated youngster will play his post-battle text. 
    - Talk to either of them again to get the rematch text
  - This is done so that the rematch text does not interfere with post-battle text that plays automatically.
- The AICheckIfHPBelowFraction now handles a fraction of 1/1, preventing giving Lorelei's dewgong tons of hp every turn.
- Trapping move changes & turn priority now being applied correctly in trainer battles.
- AI trainer movesets are now structured per yellow version, so all moves of all party pkmn can be set for any trainer
- Made shiny animations more stable
- Clearing custom bits nows happens at the InitBattle function
- Wild pokemon DV generation was moved to bank2D to allow more space for manipulation and expansion

#New features & adjustments from last version:
-----------
- Moves that hit multiple times in a turn now calculate damage and critical hits for each individual attack
- Ditto base exp yield back to 61
- Game corner reel bug fixed
- Trainer pkmn give double stat exp
- Pkmn with levels > 100 give 255 stat exp for each stat and have a base exp yield of 255
- Surfboard bugfixes:
  - cannot use the surfboard if being forced to ride the bicycle
  - no longer freezes the game when using it from the item menu to get back on land
  - the menu text will glitch a little, but only for a split-second and does not impact gameplay
- The move relearner has been expanded to detect default level-0 moves
- The limiter on vitamins is raised to a max of 62720 stat exp after the elite 4 have been beaten
- Switched out AI pkmn are tracked, and the following are ignored for determining if they will be switched out subsequent times:
  - low HP
  - having a non-volatile status condition
  - a super-effective move is being used against it
- If a pkmn has DVs that would make it shiny in Gen 2, the Reflect animation plays when it enters battle
- If playing on a super gameboy, shiny pkmn will have a palette swap on the status screen and also change color in battle
- AI routine 1 will heavily discourage roar, teleport, & whirlwind
- Readjusted prioritization of buff/debuff moves in AI routine 3
- Waking from the sleep condition no longer wastes a turn
- Can battle Mr. Fuji after beating the elite 4
- Gym leaders and elite 4 have their rosters & movesets slightly tweaked for gradual difficulty
- There is a new NPC in the route 7 underground path entrance that generates random battles after the elite 4 are beaten
  
#Bugfixes:
-----------

- Battle engine fixes
  - Moves no longer have a default 1/256 chance to miss
  - Fixed freeze that occurs in defense stat scaling (def < 4 glitch)
  - Enemy ai ignores type effectiveness for moves that have zero power
     - prevents things like spamming agility against poison pkmn
  - Enemy ai ignores super-effectiveness for moves that do static amounts of damage
  - Fixed skipping move-learn on level-up glitch. 
     - when gaining multiple levels at a time, each in-between level is incrementally checked for moves learned
     - this prevents a pkmn from skipping learnable moves if gaining multiple levels in battle
  - Burn & Paralyze stat penalties are now properly applied after Speed & Attack stats get updated/recalculated
  - Badge stat-ups don't get stacked anymore
  - If player is frozen, the hyperbeam recharge bit is now cleared
     - now matches how enemy mon's recharge bit is cleared upon being frozen
     - this prevents getting stuck in a loop unable to do anything on your turn
  - Blaine will not use a healing item at full HP
  - Move slots cannot be rearranged when transformed (prevents acquiring glitch moves).
  - The BIRD type has been reinstated and renamed to TYPELESS. It acts as a universally neutral type (particularly for Struggle)
  - AI trainers have priority on switching or using an item
  - AI type effectiveness function now takes type 1 and 2 into account together 
	 - Before AI would only look at the type it encountered first in a list search
     - AI will now treat a move as neutral if type 1 makes it supereffective but type 2 makes it not effective

- Move fixes
  - dire hit/focus energy now quadruples crit rate instead of quarters
  - sleep now normal-chance hits a pkmn recharging from hyperbeam, but has no effect if it's already status-effected
  - the fly/dig invulnerability bit is cleared when a pkmn hurts itself from confusion or is fully paralyzed
  - psywave damage is always min 1 be it an opponent or yourself (prevents desync)
  - Substitute fixes
    - all hp drain moves (including dream eater and leech seed) miss against substitute
    - substitute will not work if it would bring you to exactly 0 hp
    - zero power moves that inflict stat-downs, sleep, or paralyze will not affect a substitute
    - the confusion side-effect of damaging moves is blocked by a substitute
	- recoil damage from jump kicks or hurting oneself in confusion is now applied to user's substitute
  - healing moves work with restoring exactly 255 or 511 hp 
  - light screen and reflect now have a cap of 999
  - haze removing sleep/freeze will not prevent a multi-turn move from getting stuck
     - Fixed by allowing sleeping/frozen pkmn to use a move after haze restores them
     - on the plus size, haze now restores both opponent and user's status conditions as was intended in gen 1
  - Rest now does the following:
     - clears the toxic bit and toxic counter
     - if burn is removed, attack is doubled to undo its stat detriment (not perfect for atk values < 4)
     - if paralyze is removed, speed is quadrupled to undo its stat detriment (not perfect for atk values < 8)
  - fixed-damage moves (seismic toss, dragon rage, etc) can no longer critically hit
  - fixed-damage moves now obey type immunities
  - Transform will no longer copy the opponent's Transform move. It's swapped-out for Struggle
  - Struggle is now TYPELESS so that it can always neutrally damage something
  - Metronome & mirror move will not increment PP if the user is transformed
     - This prevents adding PP to hidden dummy moves that prevent a pkmn from going into Struggle
     - This also prevents Disable from freezing the game by targeting a dummy move
  - Mirror Move is checked against partial trapping moves in a link battle to prevent desync
  - Bide's accumulated damage bytes are now both set to zero on an enemy faint in order to prevent desync
  - Jump Kick moves now do the correct recoil damage on a miss
  - The effects of Leech Seed and Toxic no longer stack
  - Trapping effects only clear the hyperbeam recharge bit on a hit, preventing its automatic use on a miss
  - Trapping move PP can no longer underflow due to an opponent switching pkmn
  - Raging and Thrashing no longer suffers from accuracy degradation
  - Breaking a substitute does not nullify explosion/self-destruct, hyper beam recharge, or recoil damage
  - Hyper beam must recharge if it misses or knocks out the opposing pkmn
  - Bugfixes involving Counter:
    - works against BIRD type, which is now typeless and assigned only to STRUGGLE
    - To prevent desync, pressing B to get out of the move selection menu zeros-out the ram location for selected move & move power
    - last damage dealt is zeroed in these cases (also fixes some issues with Bide):
	  - it's the start of the round without a trapping move active (fixes most issues since Counter always goes second)
	  - player/enemy pkmn is fully paralyzed or after hurting itself in confusion
    - Crash damage from jump kicks and pkmn hurting itself cannot be Countered

- Misc. fixes
  - Great ball has a ball factor of 12 now

  - Enemy DVs can no longer be manipulated by having it use transform multiple times
  - Fixed a bug where itemfinder can't locate objects with a zero x or y coord
  - After defeating the cerulean burglar rocket, the guard itself always moves to prevent getting stuck in the front door
  - Game corner reel bug fixed
  - Surfboard bugfixes:
	  - cannot use the surfboard if being forced to ride the bicycle
	  - no longer freezes the game when using it from the item menu to get back on land

  - A pkmn plays its cry to signal the last turn of using a trapping move like wrap/clamp/etc
- Adjustment to the sleep condition
  - Sleep does not prevent choosing a move

  - Defense, special, and speed DVs are between 8 and 15
  - HP DV is a minimum of 8 since attack DV is always odd-numbered
- Trainer AI battles now track which enemy pkmn have already been sent out, so allows for new functionality:
  - Trainer pkmn DVs are remembered between switching, and new ones won't be generated on every send-out
  - Trainer pkmn now have stat experience assigned to them that is scaled to their level
  - These are real DVs and statEXP values that utilize the existing enemy party_struct which is normally unused by trainer AI
- Special trainers, e4, and gym leaders are slightly adjusted in their item use
- Badge stat-ups are now only applied in wild pokemon battles to give parity to enemy trainers
